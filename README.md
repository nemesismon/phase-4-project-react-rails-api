FlatIron P4 Project - Builder Exchange

-> Create a front and back end using React and Rails to produce a full web application.  The purpose of the application is to allow users to create, read, update, and delete punch items, as well as see all projects they currently have active tasks on. Users can create accounts and will have authorizations and authentications to ensure only they have access to their data.

-> Goals
  1. Use Rails backend with a React front end
  2. Proper RESTful routing
  3. Use authentication to persist sessions
  4. Include pertinent models for:
    a. one many-to-many
    b. join table
    c. implement associations
  5. Seperation of Concerns -> backend does work,        frontend is show
  6. Full CRUD on a model
  7. Client side routing
  8. Implement authentication/authorization

-> Challenges
  1. Ensuring that updates will work with missing data in both database and state
  2. Filtering duplicates of contractors with many punch items to one project
  3. Finding multiple conditions that worked for render changes without getting lost in loops
